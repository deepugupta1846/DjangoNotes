<h2 id="mvt"><b>Django Basics</b></h2>
<p>
    Django is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly
    create web application without all of the installation or dependency
    problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.
    When you’re building a website, you always need a similar set of components:
    a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out),
    a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.
    Django gives you ready-made components to use.
</p>
<h4 ><b>Django architecture</b></h4>
<p>Django is based on MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture.
    MVT is a software design pattern for developing a web application.</p>
<br/>
<p>MVT Structure has the following three parts –</p>
<p><b>Model</b>:
    Model is going to act as the interface of your data.
    It is responsible for maintaining data.
    It is the logical data structure behind the entire application and is represented by a database (generally relational databases such as MySql, Postgres).</p>
<p>
    <b>View:</b> The View is the user interface — what you see in your browser when you render a website. It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript and Jinja files.
</p>
<p id="installdjango"><b>Template:</b> A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.</p>

    <h4 id="createapp"><b>Creating an App</b></h4>
    <p>Django is famous for its unique and fully managed app structure.
        For every functionality, an app can be created like a completely independent module.
        This article will take you through how to create a basic app and add functionalities using that app.</p>
    <li><p>To create a basic app in your Django project you need to go to directory containing manage.py and from there enter the command :</p>
        <p class="text bg-secondary text-white p-3">python manage.py startapp projectApp</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To consider the app in your project you need to specify your project name in INSTALLED_APPS list as follows in settings.py:</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>So, we have finally created an app but to render the app using urls we need to include the app in our main project so that urls redirected to that app can be rendered. Let us explore it.</p>
        <p>Move to projectName-> projectName -> urls.py and add below code in the header</p>
         <p class="text bg-primary text-white p-3">from django.urls import include from django.urls import include </p>
    </li>
</ul>
